# Learnings

The cumulative log of what we discover while building Callimachus. Each component experiment in `experiments/` has its own `LEARNINGS.md` with the full detail; this top-level file collects the highlights, surprises, and decisions that bind future work.

The convention: when an experiment surfaces something that future-you (or a future contributor) needs to know — a gotcha, a non-obvious choice, a default we landed on — note it in the experiment's local LEARNINGS, and if it's broadly relevant, summarise it here in one or two sentences with a link.

## How to read this file

Entries are ordered newest-first. Each entry is short. If you need depth, follow the link to the experiment's local LEARNINGS or the relevant doc.

### 2026-05-04 — Tool calling works; ModelRetry is the lever for graceful failure

Pydantic AI's tool loop runs autonomously: type hints + docstring auto-derive the schema; `result.all_messages()` exposes the full exchange. **Parallel tool calls in a single turn work natively** — the orchestrator can fan out to N hunter tools in one round-trip. Important error-handling distinction: plain exceptions from tools propagate to the caller (model never sees them), while `pydantic_ai.ModelRetry("...")` is fed back as a `RetryPromptPart` so the model can recover. Binds: source plugins should use `ModelRetry` for graceful degradation on outages; judge/orchestrator internal failures should `raise` normally for hard fail.

Also: OpenRouter routes through multiple Anthropic backends (direct, Vertex, Bedrock) — `tool_call_id` prefixes vary (`toolu_*`, `toolu_vrtx_*`, `toolu_bdrk_*`). Don't assume the prefix shape.

Cost note: adding one tool with a one-line schema added ~1400 tokens of overhead per request. Implication: keep each agent's toolbox minimal and focused.

- **Affects**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` (source plugin contract should specify `ModelRetry` for graceful failures), `PLUGINS.md` (mention this in the Resolver/DiscoverySource Protocol docs).

### 2026-05-04 — Pydantic AI hello-world via OpenRouter green; Perplexity also on OpenRouter

`openrouter:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` works as the model string with `pydantic-ai-slim[openrouter]`. `OpenRouterProvider` reads `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from env automatically. Result API: `result.output` for text, `result.usage()` for tokens (`input_tokens`/`output_tokens`). PEP 723 inline-script metadata + `uv run` validated as the experiment-deps convention. **OpenRouter is the default LLM access pattern**; Anthropic-direct stays available as a config option. Note: OpenRouter uses dot-notation versions (`4.6`); Anthropic-direct uses dash-notation (`4-6`) — naming conventions diverge across providers.

**Bonus**: Perplexity Sonar models (`perplexity/sonar`, `sonar-pro`, `sonar-deep-research`) are available on OpenRouter too. One `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` covers both LLM (Claude) and planning-phase synthesis (Perplexity) — `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` becomes optional. Mistral OCR stays separate (different product).

- **Source**: [`experiments/01-pydantic-ai-hello/LEARNINGS.md`](experiments/01-pydantic-ai-hello/LEARNINGS.md)
- **Affects**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` (LLM access default + perplexity routing), `README.md` API keys table, `PLUGINS.md` perplexity bundled-plugin description, `.env.example`.

### 2026-05-04 — Phase 0 tooling green

Minimal package skeleton (`src/callimachus/__init__.py` exposing `__version__`) plus dev tooling all pass on first try: `uv sync --group dev`, `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `pyright` (strict mode, 0 errors), `pytest` (1 smoke test). Phase 0 of `DEV_PLAN.md` is complete; ready to move into experiment 01 (Pydantic AI hello-world).

- **Affects**: `pyproject.toml` is the source of truth for tool versions and configs. CLAUDE.md captures the coding-style brief (DRY, Pydantic at boundaries, pyright + ruff, tests where they earn their keep, docs-and-code-stay-in-sync as the golden rule).

### 2026-05-04 — env-check passes; stdlib-only is enough for experiments

Smoke test green on macOS / Python 3.14.4. Stdlib `.env` parsing handles the basic case fine; we'll switch to `pydantic-settings` for product code. Repo-root detection convention (`README.md` + `docs/`) established for future experiments to reuse.

- **Source**: [`experiments/00-env-check/LEARNINGS.md`](experiments/00-env-check/LEARNINGS.md)
- **Affects**: nothing binding — confirms baseline assumptions hold.

## Cross-cutting decisions log

A separate, narrower table of decisions that have been made and where they're recorded canonically. Use this to find "what did we decide about X?" without reading every entry.

| Minimum Python version | 3.11 | `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `experiments/00-env-check/LEARNINGS.md` |
